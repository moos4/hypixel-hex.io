# Hypixel-hex
This is a [website](https://moos4.github.io/hypixel-hex.io/) that allows you to use the hypixel skyblock hex to test out what different modifiers you want to add to an item.

made by @moos4 and @Dradshere

> [!WARNING]
> Still under developement!

## Updating
We want to keep up with all the hypixel skybock updates, but it will probably take some time before we are up-to-date.

## Our progress
you can check our progress in [our github project](https://github.com/users/moos4/projects/1)

## Helping us
You can support us by just using our website and reporting bugs or giving ideas.

## Free to use
We won't ever charge you for anything and will (most likely) never put ads on our website.
> we might put ads on our page if too many people visit our site and github charges us money.

## The textures
All of our textures for items and such come from minecraft 1.8 or if it is an item from hypixel itself it comes from [Furfsky Reborn](https://furfsky.net/).
